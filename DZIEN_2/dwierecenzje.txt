Negative Review:
Unfortunately, this film falls short on many levels. The plot is predictable and fails to engage the audience, while the acting often feels forced and unconvincing. Poor pacing makes the movie drag, with several unnecessary scenes. The visuals are unimpressive and do little to compensate for the weak script. In the end, it’s a forgettable experience not worth your time.
